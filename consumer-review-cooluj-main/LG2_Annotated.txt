This is an *absolutely brilliant T.V. The 65" is such a *massive picture with an *extremely small bezel frame and its *dramatically *thin display is *clear & *vibrant with tons of menu options to help fine tune the overall picture of each input. Excellent for gaming and watching sports & movies. It has energy saver & screensaver modes to help *minimize burn-in imagery, which can be a *problem with OLED's. Overall this is such a great product worthy of any home setup. *Beautifully built.
